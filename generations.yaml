    description: "The Volkswagen ID.4 represents the brand's first electric compact SUV built on the dedicated MEB (Modular Electric Drive Matrix) platform, designed to bring electric mobility to the high-volume SUV segment while aligning with Volkswagen's strategic shift toward electrification. Featuring clean, aerodynamic styling with smooth surfaces, flush door handles, gently sloping roofline, and distinctive lighting elements including an optional light bar connecting the headlights, the ID.4 balances contemporary design with familiar Volkswagen SUV proportions. Initially launched with a rear-mounted electric motor producing 201 horsepower (150 kW) and 229 lb-ft of torque driving the rear wheels, the lineup later expanded to include dual-motor all-wheel drive variants (ID.4 AWD/GTX depending on market) with a combined 295-299 horsepower. Battery capacity options include 52 kWh (Pure) and 77 kWh (Pro) packs, providing WLTP-rated ranges of approximately 213-324 miles depending on configuration, with DC fast charging capabilities of up to 135 kW enabling a 10-80% charge in approximately 30 minutes under ideal conditions. The interior features a minimalist, spacious design emphasizing the packaging advantages of the MEB platform, with a standard 10-inch (or optional 12-inch) touchscreen infotainment system, compact digital instrument display, and ambient lighting with customizable color options. Most physical buttons are replaced by touch-sensitive controls, with voice commands providing additional interaction options. Passenger and cargo space benefit from the purpose-built electric platform, offering interior volume comparable to larger SUVs within a compact footprint. Advanced driver assistance systems include Travel Assist for partially automated driving, emergency braking, and enhanced parking capabilities. Continuous software updates have improved functionality throughout production, addressing some early criticism of the infotainment system's responsiveness and features. As one of the first mainstream electric SUVs from an established global manufacturer, the ID.4 plays a crucial role in Volkswagen's electrification strategy, targeting one of the most popular and competitive vehicle segments worldwide while offering a combination of practical range, charging capabilities, and familiar SUV versatility at a more accessible price point than many premium electric alternatives."
